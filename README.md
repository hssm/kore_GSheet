kore_GSheet
===========

The scripts I am using to find and fix errors in the Core 2k/6k deck. It's also what I use to maintain parity between my Core 2k/6k anki deck and the main Google Spreadsheet from which new versions of that deck are ultimately generated. (That is, I sync between the two using the Google spreadsheet API).


This is mostly throwaway code, which explains why it's so hideous (I did a copy+paste every time I needed a new function). There's really no use for it after the deck has been cleaned and the upadtes pushed to the main spreadsheet.

The code that talks to the Google spreadsheet can serve as a useful reference in the future, however.
