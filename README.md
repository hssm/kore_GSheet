kore_GSheet
===========

The tools I am using to maintain parity between my kore2k/6k anki deck and the main Google Spreadsheet from which new versions of that deck are ultimately generated.

This is mostly throwaway code since Anki 1 will eventually be replaced, and most of the verifiers won't be used again once they're done doing their job. The useful part is having a reference for talking to a Google Spreadsheet, which admittedly is fairly poorly documented for the python side of things. I might document parts of it, but I've already decided that a Google Spreadsheet is a terrible idea for this sort of thing and would hope to avoid it in the future.
